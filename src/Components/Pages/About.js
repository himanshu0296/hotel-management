           Envisaging its success and positive reception in the industry, Pallavi Hotels & Resorts is on the crest of a wave in Panchkula, Chandigarh, Mohali Region. Pallavi Group of Hotels came ashore in the hospitality segment with Pallavi Banquets & Restaurants (Now Hotel Pallavi) in Panchkula and since then there is no looking back. Today, we have extended our services in areas of Navi Mumbai, Alleppey and Kochi and we endeavor to create a presence across the country by 2015.<br/>

Veteran in the hospitality industry, Pallavi Hotels & Resorts does not believe in following the conventional trends and is always bringing into motion some innovative ideas. Ventures like Pallavi Ã VIDA, Pallavi Houseboats and Pallavi Floating Villas vouch for the fervency of the group towards innovation.<br/>

Pallavi Hotels & Resorts is on an aggressive expansion graph through a Management Contract model throughout India with a primary focus on providing management expertise to properties in the budget, boutique and mid-market segments. <br/>

The Pallavi Group is also foraying into Serviced Apartments with its first property coming up in Navi Mumbai very shortly.
